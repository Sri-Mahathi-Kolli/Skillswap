## ðŸ”§ **Amount and Display Issues Fixed**

### **Problems Fixed:**

1. **Amount Calculation Error**:
   - **Issue**: Session payment component was sending amounts in dollars (e.g., 20) but Stripe expects cents
   - **Fix**: Modified `calculateAmount()` to multiply by 100 (e.g., 20 â†’ 2000 cents)

2. **Duplicate Payment Records**:
   - **Issue**: Both our new endpoint AND Stripe webhooks were creating dual records
   - **Fix**: Added duplicate prevention in Stripe webhook handler

3. **Wrong Payment Types**:
   - **Issue**: Host payments were showing as 'session' instead of 'earning'
   - **Fix**: Host payments now correctly set to 'earning' (positive display)

4. **Missing Metadata**:
   - **Issue**: Payments missing proper FROM/TO information
   - **Fix**: Added complete metadata with recipientName, payerName, etc.

### **Amount Flow Now:**
```
Frontend: $20 â†’ calculateAmount() â†’ 2000 cents
Backend: Stores 2000 cents in database  
Display: 2000 Ã· 100 = $20.00 âœ…
```

### **Payment Display Logic:**
```
Student Record: paymentType = 'session' â†’ Shows: -$20.00 (red)
Host Record: paymentType = 'earning' â†’ Shows: +$20.00 (green)
```

### **Test Now:**

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Make new payment**: http://localhost:4200/payments/session?expertId=68b62cb1f36811ef63ca4f19&expertName=Sundari&hourlyRate=20&currency=USD
3. **Check both payment histories**:
   - Student should see: "From: You" â†’ "To: Sundari" -$20.00
   - Host should see: "From: Student" â†’ "To: You" +$20.00

### **Expected Results:**
âœ… Correct amounts (not wrong numbers)
âœ… Correct signs (+ for host, - for student)  
âœ… Correct FROM/TO information
âœ… Appears in both UIs
âœ… No duplicates

The amount calculation and all display issues should now be fixed! ðŸŽ¯
